# Documentation for Jewel

This directory contains scripts and analysis macros for the JEFF measurement in JEWEL simulations. These analysis and plotting scripts were based on earlier versions provided by Marco. 
Below are some details or instructions you may find helpful.

Instructions for Jewel

**Signal**: It holds some steering macros and scheduling scripts for the stoomboot cluster. Given the update of the stoomboot server it is highly likely that these scripts are obsolete and require update. In a subdirectory for each collision case/system, there is a script for the analysis of the JEWEL simulations as well as a plotting macro that should produce the final plots presented in the thesis.

**Embedded** This directory refers to the short term study of JEWEL AA simulations embedded in a thermal medium which was undertaken to examine the sensitivity of the JEFF observable to the underlying event of the heavy-ion collisions.
